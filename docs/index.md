# Archipelago API Overview

The Archipelago API is a REST-based API to facilitate transactions and retrieve information on the Archipelago marketplace.

## Base Path

The API base path is: `https://api.archipelago.art/:version`

Currently `v1` is the latest and only version, so all API calls should be made to `https://api.archipelago.art/v1`

All requests must be made over HTTPS.
