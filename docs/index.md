# üè° Overview

This site serves as documentation for the [Archipelago Art](https://archipelago.art/) APIs. You can either navigate using the sidebar on the left, or by using the search functionality in the search box above.

The Archipelago APIs allow you to interact with the Archipelago marketplace. You can use the APIs to:

- Execute market orders (e.g. buy and sell tokens) 
  - üöß **Note:** More information and client libraries for executing orders will be released soon.
- Get detailed information about a specific collection or token (e.g. traits, features, etc.)
- Retreive information about your own bids and asks
- Lookup a user's collection of tokens
- Subscribe to events on the marketplace (e.g. new orders, new bids, etc.)
