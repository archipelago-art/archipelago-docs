# Archipelago API Overview

The Archipelago API is a REST-based API to facilitate transactions and retrieve information on the Archipelago marketplace.

## Base Path

The API base path is: `https://api.archipelago.art/:version`

Currently `v1` is the latest and only version, so all API calls should be made to `https://api.archipelago.art/v1`

All requests must be made over HTTPS.

## Authentication

The Archipelago API has a combination of unauthenticated and authenticated endpoints available. Each endpoint's documentation specifies whether or not authentication is required.

If authentication is required for a request, you will need to specify the following header that includes your Archipelago API Token: `x-archipelago-frontend-token: [YOUR TOKEN HERE]`.

Example requests that show how to include this header can be found for each necessary endpoint in the [Resources & Routes](#-Resources-amp-Routes) documentation below.

If no authentication is required, simply call the API per the documentation.

### To Obtain a Token:

:lock: _Keep this token safe and do not share this token with others, or store it in publicly accessible areas!_

1. Go to [Archipelago](https://archipelago.art) and connect your Ethereum wallet
2. Sign the message to grant your token (found in the 'user pages' nav once your wallet is connected)
3. Use your browser dev tools to find the `window.localStorage` data
4. Within the local storage you will find your token: `x-archipelago-frontend-token:{yourAddress}: {yourToken}`
5. Save and use the value -- the `{yourToken}` portion -- as your API token for authenticated requests

## Errors

Archipelago uses the conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

### Status Codes

| Status Code            | Summary                                      |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **200** - OK           | Everything worked as expected.               |
| **400** - Bad Request  | The request was not structured properly.     |
| **401** - Unauthorized | No valid API key was provided.               |
| **404** - Not Found    | The requested API resource was not found.    |
| **500** - Server Error | Something went wrong on the Archipelago end. |

## :racehorse: Rate Limits

The Archipelago API does enforce rate limits for each client. Every response from the Archipelago API includes two headers related to rate limits:

- `x-rate-limit-max`: the maximum request limit for your token, by default this is `40`
- `x-rate-limit-remaining`: the capacity remaining out of the total limit

The `x-rate-limit-remaining` header will change based on the number of requests made.

**Importantly**, if the rate limit is reached, a 429 HTTP error code will be returned from the API.
