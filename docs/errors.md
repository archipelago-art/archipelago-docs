# ‚ùó Errors

Archipelago uses the conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

## Status Codes

| Status Code            | Summary                                      |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **200** - OK           | Everything worked as expected.               |
| **400** - Bad Request  | The request was not structured properly.     |
| **401** - Unauthorized | No valid API key was provided.               |
| **404** - Not Found    | The requested API resource was not found.    |
| **500** - Server Error | Something went wrong on the Archipelago end. |

# üêé Rate Limits

The Archipelago API does enforce rate limits for each client. Every response from the Archipelago API includes two headers related to rate limits:

- `x-rate-limit-max`: the maximum request limit for your token, by default this is `40`
- `x-rate-limit-remaining`: the capacity remaining out of the total limit

The `x-rate-limit-remaining` header will change based on the number of requests made.

**Importantly**, if the rate limit is reached, a 429 HTTP error code will be returned from the API.
